    "## Get Tweet Counts and Save as Spreadsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we're going to do is retrieve \"tweet counts\" — that is, retrieve the number of tweets that include a given query each day in Twitter's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [tweet counts API endpoint](https://twittercommunity.com/t/introducing-new-tweet-counts-endpoints-to-the-twitter-api-v2/155997) is a convenient feature of the v2 API (first introduced in 2021) that allows us to get a sense of how many tweets will be returned for a given query before we actually collect all the tweets that match the query. We won't get the text of the tweets or the users who tweeted the tweets or any other relevant data. We will simply get the number of tweets that match the query. This is helpful because we might be able to see that the search query matches too many tweets, which would encourage us to narrow our search by modifying the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tweet counts API endpoint is perhaps even more useful for research projects that are primarily interested in tracking the volume of a Twitter conversation over time. In this case, tweet counts enable a researcher to retrieve this information in a way that's faster and easier than retrieving all tweets and relevant metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get tweet counts from Twitter's entire history with twarc2, we will use [`twarc2 counts`](https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twarc2/#counts) followed by a search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use the flag `--csv` because we want to output the data as a CSV, the flag `--archive` because we're working with the Academic Research track of the Twitter API and want access to the full archive, and the flag `--granularity day` to get tweet counts per day (other options include `hour` and `minute`.  Finally, we write the data to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see other options, please refer to [twarc's documentation for `twarc2 counts`](https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twarc2/#counts)"

To reduce potential harm to Twitter users when re-publishing or citing tweets, it can be helpful to ask for explicit permission from the authors or to focus on tweets that have already been reasonably exposed to the public (e.g., tweets with many retweets or tweets from verified users), such that re-publishing the content will not unduly increase risk to the user.\n",
